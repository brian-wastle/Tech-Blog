# Tech.Perspectives

## Description

I've been looking for a good tech blog that focuses on the perspectives and stories of new developers breaking into the field for the first time. I decided to create a clean, simple blog that you can use to share your experience, as well as communicate and connect with other like-minded developers online. This was also an opportunity to build my own front and backend code with authentification.
